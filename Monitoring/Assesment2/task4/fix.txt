### Fix 1 — Base Image Updated
Changed from: python:3.9-slim  
To: python:3.9-alpine  
Reason: Alpine has fewer packages → fewer vulnerabilities.

### Fix 2 — Added non-root user
Security improvement: container now runs as unprivileged user.

### Fix 3 — Removed cache layers
Reduces attack surface.

Result:
- Critical vulnerabilities reduced
- High vulnerabilities reduced
